		// It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

		// The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

		// With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

		"use strict";

		// x = 5;

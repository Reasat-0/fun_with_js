		// The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.

		// It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

		// The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

		// With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

		"use strict";

		// x = 5;

		// console.log(x)

		// this keyword in strict mode...

		function Hola(){
			console.log(this)
		}

		Hola();
